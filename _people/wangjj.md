## Research Experience
Hong Kong Baptist University
2021 – Present: Metagenome-wide association analysis
Worked with collaborators and identified tryptamine-producing species Ruminococcus gnavus associated with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome, resulting in 1 publication.
Constructed the population-based human gut microbial genomic variation (SNVs, dSVs, and vSVs) database from large-scale metagenomic sequencing data worldwide. 
Analyzed the human gut microbial genomic variation differences between the Chinese and non-Chinese populations; the abstract was accepted for ISMB 2024; the full paper is in preparation.
Causal association analysis of irritable bowel syndrome at microbial genomic variation level (ongoing).

2020 – 2021: Genome assembly 
Benchmarked multi-platform sequencing technologies for human genome assembly, resulting in 1 publication.

Beijing Jiaotong University
2017 – 2020: Data mining in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM)  
Analyzed the diversity and molecular network patterns of TCM symptom phenotypes, resulting in 1 publication.
Identified hypertension patient subgroups and recognized their main symptoms and pathways, resulting in 1 publication.
Developed a chronic disease data analysis and mining web system based on the Python Flash framework.
Identified combinational rules of Chinese herb prescriptions for treating pediatric cough, resulting in 1 publication.
