	abstract = {Although long-read sequencing enables the generation of complete genomes for unculturable microbes, its high cost limits the widespread adoption of long-read sequencing in large-scale metagenomic studies. An alternative method is to assemble short-reads with long-range connectivity, which can be a cost-effective way to generate high-quality microbial genomes. Here, we develop Pangaea, a bioinformatic approach designed to enhance metagenome assembly using short-reads with long-range connectivity. Pangaea leverages connectivity derived from physical barcodes of linked-reads or virtual barcodes by aligning short-reads to long-reads. Pangaea utilizes a deep learning-based read binning algorithm to assemble co-barcoded reads exhibiting similar sequence contexts and abundances, thereby improving the assembly of high- and medium-abundance microbial genomes. Pangaea also leverages a multi-thresholding algorithm strategy to refine assembly for low-abundance microbes. We benchmark Pangaea on linked-reads and a combination of short- and long-reads from simulation data, mock communities and human gut metagenomes. Pangaea achieves significantly higher contig continuity as well as more near-complete metagenome-assembled genomes (NCMAGs) than the existing assemblers. Pangaea also generates three complete and circular NCMAGs on the human gut microbiomes.},

Yet, how such methods compare to each other in terms of their ability to identify disease-relevant modules in different types of network remains poorly understood. We launched the 'Disease Module Identification {DREAM} Challenge', an open competition to comprehensively assess module identification methods across diverse protein-protein interaction, signaling, gene co-expression, homology and cancer-gene networks. Predicted network modules were tested for association with complex traits and diseases using a unique collection of 180 genome-wide association studies. Our robust assessment of 75 module identification methods reveals top-performing algorithms, which recover complementary trait-associated modules. We find that most of these modules correspond to core disease-relevant pathways, which often comprise therapeutic targets. This community challenge establishes biologically interpretable benchmarks, tools and guidelines for molecular network analysis to study human disease biology.},

	abstract = {As an economic crop, pepper satisfies people's spicy taste and has medicinal uses worldwide. To gain a better understanding of Capsicum evolution, domestication, and specialization, we present here the genome sequence of the cultivated pepper Zunla-1 (C. annuum L.) and its wild progenitor Chiltepin (C. annuum var. glabriusculum). We estimate that the pepper genome expanded ~0.3 Mya (with respect to the genome of other Solanaceae) by a rapid amplification of retrotransposons elements, resulting in a genome comprised of ~81\% repetitive sequences. Approximately 79\% of 3.48-Gb scaffolds containing 34,476 protein-coding genes were anchored to chromosomes by a high-density genetic map. Comparison of cultivated and wild pepper genomes with 20 resequencing accessions revealed molecular footprints of artificial selection, providing us with a list of candidate domestication genes. We also found that dosage compensation effect of tandem duplication genes probably contributed to the pungent diversification in pepper. The Capsicum reference genome provides crucial information for the study of not only the evolution of the pepper genome but also, the Solanaceae family, and it will facilitate the establishment of more effective pepper breeding programs.},

Integrating comparative genomics and analyses of gene expression yields multiple insights into butterfly evolution, including potential roles of specific genes in recent diversification. To functionally test gene function, we develop an efficient (up to 92.5\%) {CRISPR}/Cas9 gene editing method that yields obvious phenotypes with three genes, Abdominal-B, ebony and frizzled.

Here we sequence and analyse the {BMR} genome and transcriptome, highlighting the possible genomic adaptive responses to the underground stressors. Our results show high rates of {RNA}/{DNA} editing, reduced chromosome rearrangements, an over-representation of short interspersed elements ({SINEs}) probably linked to hypoxia tolerance, degeneration of vision and progression of photoperiodic perception, tolerance to hypercapnia and hypoxia and resistance to cancer.

Many computational tools have been developed to construct and annotate {MAGs} from metagenomic sequencing, however, there is a prominent gap to comprehensively introduce their background and practical performance. In this paper, we have thoroughly investigated the computational tools designed for both upstream and downstream analyses, including metagenome assembly, metagenome binning, gene prediction, functional annotation, taxonomic classification, and profiling. We have categorized the commonly used tools into unique groups based on their functional background and introduced the underlying core algorithms and associated information to demonstrate a comparative outlook. Furthermore, we have emphasized the computational requisition and offered guidance to the users to select the most efficient tools. Finally, we have indicated current limitations, potential solutions, and future perspectives for further improving the tools of {MAG} construction and annotation. We believe that our work provides a consolidated resource for the current stage of {MAG} studies and shed light on the future development of more effective {MAG} analysis tools on metagenomic sequencing.},

However, this approach has not been applied to explore the impact of de novo mutations on {PD} pathogenesis. Here, we sequenced the exomes of 39 early onset patients, their parents, and 20 unaffected siblings to investigate the effects of de novo mutations on {PD}. We identified 12 genes with de novo mutations ({MAD}1L1, {NUP}98, {PPP}2CB, {PKMYT}1, {TRIM}24, {CEP}131, {CTTNBP}2, {NUS}1, {SMPD}3, {MGRN}1, {IFI}35, and {RUSC}2), which could be functionally relevant to {PD} pathogenesis. Further analyses of two independent case-control cohorts (1,852 patients and 1,565 controls in one cohort and 3,237 patients and 2,858 controls in the other) revealed that {NUS}1 harbors significantly more rare nonsynonymous variants (P = 1.01E-5, odds ratio = 11.3) in {PD} patients than in controls. Functional studies in Drosophila demonstrated that the loss of {NUS}1 could reduce the climbing ability, dopamine level, and number of dopaminergic neurons in 30-day-old flies and could induce apoptosis in fly brain. Together, our data suggest that de novo mutations could contribute to early onset {PD} pathogenesis and identify {NUS}1 as a candidate gene for {PD}.},

	abstract = {Background Several case-control studies have been performed to examine the association of genetic variants in lysyl oxidase ({LOX}) with keratoconus. However, the results remained inconclusive and great heterogeneity might exist across populations. Method A comprehensive literature search for studies that published up to June 25, 2015 was performed. Summary odds ratios ({OR}) and 95\% confidence intervals ({CI}) of each single nucleotide polymorphism ({SNP}) were estimated with fixed effects model when I2{\textless}50\% in the test for heterogeneity or random effects model when I2{\textgreater}50\%. Publication bias was evaluated using funnel plots and Egger’s test. Results A total of four studies including 1,467 keratoconus cases and 4,490 controls were involved in this meta-analysis. {SNPs} rs2956540 and rs10519694 showed significant association with keratoconus, with {ORs} of 0.71 (95\% {CI}: 0.63–0.80, P = 1.43E-08) and 0.77 (95\% {CI}: 0.61–0.97, P = 0.026), respectively. In contrast, our study lacked sufficient evidences to support the association of rs1800449/rs2288393 with keratoconus across populations. Conclusion This meta-analysis suggested that two {LOX} variants, rs2956540 and rs10519694, may affect individual susceptibility to keratoconus, while distinct heterogeneity existed within this locus. Larger-scale and multi-ethnic genetic studies on keratoconus are required to further validate the results.},

	abstract = {Diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome ({IBS}-D), a globally prevalent functional gastrointestinal ({GI}) disorder, is associated with elevated serotonin that increases gut motility. While anecdotal evidence suggests that the gut microbiota contributes to serotonin biosynthesis, mechanistic insights are limited. We determined that the bacterium Ruminococcus gnavus plays a pathogenic role in {IBS}-D. Monocolonization of germ-free mice with R. gnavus induced {IBS}-D-like symptoms, including increased {GI} transit and colonic secretion, by stimulating the production of peripheral serotonin. R. gnavus-mediated catabolism of dietary phenylalanine and tryptophan generated phenethylamine and tryptamine that directly stimulated serotonin biosynthesis in intestinal enterochromafﬁn cells via a mechanism involving activation of trace amine-associated receptor 1 ({TAAR}1). This R. gnavus-driven increase in serotonin levels elevated {GI} transit and colonic secretion but was abrogated upon {TAAR}1 inhibition. Collectively, our study provides molecular and pathogenetic insights into how gut microbial metabolites derived from dietary essential amino acids affect serotonin-dependent control of gut motility.},

	abstract = {Systemic lupus erythematosus ({SLE}) is a prototypic autoimmune disease that affects mainly females. What role the X chromosome plays in the disease has always been an intriguing question. In this study, we examined the genetic variants on the X chromosome through meta-analysis of two genome-wide association studies ({GWAS}) on {SLE} on Chinese Han populations. Prominent association signals from the meta-analysis were replicated in 4 additional Asian cohorts, with a total of 5373 cases and 9166 matched controls. We identified a novel variant in {PRPS}2 on Xp22.3 as associated with {SLE} with genome-wide significance (rs7062536, {OR} = 0.84, P = 1.00E−08). Association of the L1CAM-{MECP}2 region with {SLE} was reported previously. In this study, we identified independent contributors in this region in {NAA}10 (rs2071128, {OR} = 0.81, P = 2.19E−13) and {TMEM}187 (rs17422, {OR} = 0.75, P = 1.47E−15), in addition to replicating the association from {IRAK}1-{MECP}2 region (rs1059702, {OR} = 0.71, P = 2.40E−18) in Asian cohorts. The X-linked susceptibility variants showed higher effect size in males than that in females, similar to results from a genome-wide survey of associated {SNPs} on the autosomes. These results suggest that susceptibility genes identified on the X chromosome, while contributing to disease predisposition, might not contribute significantly to the female predominance of this prototype autoimmune disease.},

Its complexity is reflected by extensive genetic heterogeneity and much of the genetic liability remains unaccounted for. We applied a combined strategy involving detection of copy number variants ({CNVs}), whole-genome mapping and exome sequencing to identify the genetic basis of autosomal-dominant {SCZ} in a Chinese family. To rule out pathogenic {CNVs}, we first performed Illumina single nucleotide polymorphism ({SNP}) array analysis on samples from two patients and one psychiatrically healthy family member, but no pathogenic {CNVs} were detected. In order to further narrow down the susceptible region, we conducted genome-wide linkage analysis and mapped the disease locus to chromosome 7q21.13-22.3, with a maximum multipoint logarithm of odds score of 2.144. Whole-exome sequencing was then carried out with samples from three affected individuals and one unaffected individual in the family. A missense variation c.9575 C {\textgreater} G (p.Thr3192Ser) was identified in {RELN}, which is known as a risk gene for {SCZ}, located on chromosome 7q22, in the pedigree. This rare variant, as a highly penetrant risk variant, co-segregated with the phenotype. Our results provide genetic evidence that {RELN} may be one of pathogenic gene in {SCZ}.},

	abstract = {Single-cell {RNA} sequencing has enabled to capture the gene activities at single-cell resolution, thus allowing reconstruction of cell-type-specific gene regulatory networks ({GRNs}). The available algorithms for reconstructing {GRNs} are commonly designed for bulk {RNA}-seq data, and few of them are applicable to analyze {scRNA}-seq data by dealing with the dropout events and cellular heterogeneity. In this paper, we represent the joint gene expression distribution of a gene pair as an image and propose a novel supervised deep neural network called {DeepDRIM} which utilizes the image of the target {TF}-gene pair and the ones of the potential neighbors to reconstruct {GRN} from {scRNA}-seq data. Due to the consideration of {TF}-gene pair’s neighborhood context, {DeepDRIM} can effectively eliminate the false positives caused by transitive gene–gene interactions. We compared {DeepDRIM} with nine {GRN} reconstruction algorithms designed for either bulk or single-cell {RNA}-seq data. It achieves evidently better performance for the {scRNA}-seq data collected from eight cell lines. The simulated data show that {DeepDRIM} is robust to the dropout rate, the cell number and the size of the training data. We further applied {DeepDRIM} to the {scRNA}-seq gene expression of B cells from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of the patients with mild and severe coronavirus disease 2019. We focused on the cell-type-specific {GRN} alteration and observed targets of {TFs} that were differentially expressed between the two statuses to be enriched in lysosome, apoptosis, response to decreased oxygen level and microtubule, which had been proved to be associated with coronavirus infection.},

In this study, we investigate in depth how the parameter space of 10x library preparation and sequencing affects assembly quality, on the basis of both simulated and real libraries.We prepared and sequenced eight 10x libraries with a diverse set of parameters from standard cell lines {NA}12878 and {NA}24385 and performed whole-genome assembly on the data. We also developed the simulator {LRTK}-{SIM} to follow the workflow of 10x data generation and produce realistic simulated Linked-Read data sets. We found that assembly quality could be improved by increasing the total sequencing coverage (C) and keeping physical coverage of {DNA} fragments ({CF}) or read coverage per fragment ({CR}) within broad ranges. The optimal physical coverage was between 332× and 823× and assembly quality worsened if it increased to \&gt;1,000× for a given C. Long {DNA} fragments could significantly extend phase blocks but decreased contig contiguity. The optimal length-weighted fragment length (W\$\{{\textbackslash}mu \_\{{FL}\}\}\$) was ∼50–150 kb. When broadly optimal parameters were used for library preparation and sequencing, ∼80\% of the genome was assembled in a diploid state.The Linked-Read libraries we generated and the parameter space we identified provide theoretical considerations and practical guidelines for personal genome assemblies based on 10x Linked-Read sequencing.},

However, like many other risk alleles for complex diseases, little is known on how these genetic variants might affect disease pathogenesis. In this study, we examined serum {IL}-17 levels from 283 {SLE} cases and observed a significant correlation between risk variants in {ETS}1 and serum {IL}-17 concentration in patients, which suggests a potential mechanistic link between these variants and the disease. Furthermore, we found that the two variants act synergistically in influencing {IL}-17 production, with evidence of significant genetic interaction between them as well as higher correlation between the haplotype formed by the risk alleles and {IL}-17 level in patient serum. In addition, the correlation between {ETS}1 variants and {IL}-17 level seems to be more significant in {SLE} patients manifesting renal involvement, {dsDNA} autoantibody production or early-onset.},

	abstract = {Circularity confers protection to viral genomes where linearity falls short, thereby fulfilling the form follows function aphorism. However, a shift away from morphology-based classification toward the molecular and ecological classification of viruses is currently underway within the field of virology. Recent years have seen drastic changes in the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses’ operational definitions of viruses, particularly for the tailed phages that inhabit the human gut. After the abolition of the order Caudovirales, these tailed phages are best defined as members of the class Caudoviricetes. To determine the epistemological value of genome topology in the context of the human gut virome, we designed a set of seven experiments to assay the impact of genome topology and representative viral selection on biological interpretation. Using Oxford Nanopore long reads for viral genome assembly coupled with Illumina short-read polishing, we showed that circular and linear virus genomes differ remarkably in terms of genome quality, {GC} skew, transfer {RNA} gene frequency, structural variant frequency, cross-reference functional annotation ({COG}, {KEGG}, Pfam, and {TIGRfam}), state-of-the-art marker-based classification, and phage–host interaction. Furthermore, the disparity profile changes during dereplication. In particular, our phage–host interaction results demonstrated that proportional abundances cannot be meaningfully compared without due regard for genome topology and dereplication threshold, which necessitates the need for standardized reporting. As a best practice guideline, we recommend that comparative studies of the human gut virome always report the ratio of circular to linear viral genomes along with the dereplication threshold so that structural and functional metrics can be placed into context when assessing biologically relevant metagenomic properties such as proportional abundance.},

We applied {LRTK} on linked reads from simulation, mock community, and real datasets for both human genome and metagenome. We showcased {LRTK}’s ability to generate comparative performance results from preceding benchmark studies and to report these results in publication-ready {HTML} document plots.{LRTK} provides comprehensive and flexible modules along with an easy-to-use Python-based workflow for processing linked-read sequencing datasets, thereby filling the current gap in the field caused by platform-centric genome-specific linked-read data analysis tools.},

	abstract = {Genome assembly is a computational technique that involves piecing together deoxyribonucleic acid ({DNA}) fragments generated by sequencing technologies to create a comprehensive and precise representation of the entire genome. Generating a high-quality human reference genome is a crucial prerequisite for comprehending human biology, and it is also vital for downstream genomic variation analysis. Many efforts have been made over the past few decades to create a complete and gapless reference genome for humans by using a diverse range of advanced sequencing technologies. Several available tools are aimed at enhancing the quality of haploid and diploid human genome assemblies, which include contig assembly, polishing of contig errors, scaffolding and variant phasing. Selecting the appropriate tools and technologies remains a daunting task despite several studies have investigated the pros and cons of different assembly strategies. The goal of this paper was to benchmark various strategies for human genome assembly by combining sequencing technologies and tools on two publicly available samples ({NA}12878 and {NA}24385) from Genome in a Bottle. We then compared their performances in terms of continuity, accuracy, completeness, variant calling and phasing. We observed that {PacBio} {HiFi} long-reads are the optimal choice for generating an assembly with low base errors. On the other hand, we were able to produce the most continuous contigs with Oxford Nanopore long-reads, but they may require further polishing to improve on quality. We recommend using short-reads rather than long-reads themselves to improve the base accuracy of contigs from Oxford Nanopore long-reads. Hi-C is the best choice for chromosome-level scaffolding because it can capture the longest-range {DNA} connectedness compared to 10× linked-reads and Bionano optical maps. However, a combination of multiple technologies can be used to further improve the quality and completeness of genome assembly. For diploid assembly, hifiasm is the best tool for human diploid genome assembly using {PacBio} {HiFi} and Hi-C data. Looking to the future, we expect that further advancements in human diploid assemblers will leverage the power of {PacBio} {HiFi} reads and other technologies with long-range {DNA} connectedness to enable the generation of high-quality, chromosome-level and haplotype-resolved human genome assemblies.},

Here, we present {IGSimpute}, an accurate and interpretable imputation method for recovering missing values in {scRNA}-seq data with an interpretable instance-wise gene selection layer ({GSL}). {IGSimpute} outperforms 12 other state-of-the-art imputation methods on 13 out of 17 datasets from different {scRNA}-seq technologies with the lowest mean squared error as the chosen benchmark metric. We demonstrate that {IGSimpute} can give unbiased estimates of the missing values compared to other methods, regardless of whether the average gene expression values are small or large. Clustering results of imputed profiles show that {IGSimpute} offers statistically significant improvement over other imputation methods. By taking the heart-and-aorta and the limb muscle tissues as examples, we show that {IGSimpute} can also denoise gene expression profiles by removing outlier entries with unexpectedly high expression values via the instance-wise {GSL}. We also show that genes selected by the instance-wise {GSL} could indicate the age of B cells from bladder fat tissue of the Tabula Muris Senis atlas. {IGSimpute} can impute one million cells using 64 min, and thus applicable to large datasets.},

	abstract = {Metagenome assembly is an efficient approach to reconstruct microbial genomes from metagenomic sequencing data. Although short-read sequencing has been widely used for metagenome assembly, linked- and long-read sequencing have shown their advancements in assembly by providing long-range {DNA} connectedness. Many metagenome assembly tools were developed to simplify the assembly graphs and resolve the repeats in microbial genomes. However, there remains no comprehensive evaluation of metagenomic sequencing technologies, and there is a lack of practical guidance on selecting the appropriate metagenome assembly tools. This paper presents a comprehensive benchmark of 19 commonly used assembly tools applied to metagenomic sequencing datasets obtained from simulation, mock communities or human gut microbiomes. These datasets were generated using mainstream sequencing platforms, such as Illumina and {BGISEQ} short-read sequencing, 10x Genomics linked-read sequencing, and {PacBio} and Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing. The assembly tools were extensively evaluated against many criteria, which revealed that long-read assemblers generated high contig contiguity but failed to reveal some medium- and high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes ({MAGs}). Linked-read assemblers obtained the highest number of overall near-complete {MAGs} from the human gut microbiomes. Hybrid assemblers using both short- and long-read sequencing were promising methods to improve both total assembly length and the number of near-complete {MAGs}. This paper also discussed the running time and peak memory consumption of these assembly tools and provided practical guidance on selecting them.},

	abstract = {Quantifying an individual’s risk for common diseases is an important goal of precision health. The polygenic risk score ({PRS}), which aggregates multiple risk alleles of candidate diseases, has emerged as a standard approach for identifying high-risk individuals. Although several studies have been performed to benchmark the {PRS} calculation tools and assess their potential to guide future clinical applications, some issues remain to be further investigated, such as lacking (i) various simulated data with different genetic effects; (ii) evaluation of machine learning models and (iii) evaluation on multiple ancestries studies. In this study, we systematically validated and compared 13 statistical methods, 5 machine learning models and 2 ensemble models using simulated data with additive and genetic interaction models, 22 common diseases with internal training sets, 4 common diseases with external summary statistics and 3 common diseases for trans-ancestry studies in {UK} Biobank. The statistical methods were better in simulated data from additive models and machine learning models have edges for data that include genetic interactions. Ensemble models are generally the best choice by integrating various statistical methods. {LDpred}2 outperformed the other standalone tools, whereas {PRS}-{CS}, lassosum and {DBSLMM} showed comparable performance. We also identified that disease heritability strongly affected the predictive performance of all methods. Both the number and effect sizes of risk {SNPs} are important; and sample size strongly influences the performance of all methods. For the trans-ancestry studies, we found that the performance of most methods became worse when training and testing sets were from different populations.},

	abstract = {Time-course single-cell {RNA} sequencing ({scRNA}-seq) data have been widely used to explore dynamic changes in gene expression of transcription factors ({TFs}) and their target genes. This information is useful to reconstruct cell-type-specific gene regulatory networks ({GRNs}). However, the existing tools are commonly designed to analyze either time-course bulk gene expression data or static {scRNA}-seq data via pseudo-time cell ordering. A few methods successfully utilize the information from multiple time points while also considering the characteristics of {scRNA}-seq data. We proposed {dynDeepDRIM}, a novel deep learning model to reconstruct {GRNs} using time-course {scRNA}-seq data. It represents the joint expression of a gene pair as an image and utilizes the image of the target {TF}–gene pair and the ones of the potential neighbors to reconstruct {GRNs} from time-course {scRNA}-seq data. {dynDeepDRIM} can effectively remove the transitive {TF}–gene interactions by considering neighborhood context and model the gene expression dynamics using high-dimensional tensors. We compared {dynDeepDRIM} with six {GRN} reconstruction methods on both simulation and four real time-course {scRNA}-seq data. {dynDeepDRIM} achieved substantially better performance than the other methods in inferring {TF}–gene interactions and eliminated the false positives effectively. We also applied {dynDeepDRIM} to annotate gene functions and found it achieved evidently better performance than the other tools due to considering the neighbor genes.},
